    <h3>Chicken Noodle Soup Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Onions and Celery</strong>: In the first step of this chicken noodle soup recipe, diced onions and chopped celery are cooked in butter until they're aromatic and tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Broth</strong>: This chicken noodle soup recipe calls for a mixture of chicken and vegetable broths. If you're short on time or ingredients, you can just use one or the other.</li>
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong>: Of course, you'll need chicken. If you have leftover rotisserie chicken, you can use that in place of the cooked chicken breasts for a budget-friendly shortcut.</li>
        <li><strong>Noodles</strong>: Make sure you don't add the noodles too early, as cooking them too long will make them mushy.</li>
        <li><strong>Carrots</strong>: Carrots, which add a pop of bright color and flavor, are added at the end of cooking so they stay crisp. You can add them to the saut√©ed vegetables at the beginning if you like your carrots tender.</li>
        <li><strong>Basil and Oregano</strong>: Dried basil and oregano lend warm, earthy flavor to this chicken noodle soup recipe.</li>
    </ul>
